## Go Koans

Want to learn Go? Want to do it easily? Want to have fun with it? Want lots of money?

I can't help you out with that last one. Sorry.

### Usage

  1. [Install Go](https://golang.org/dl/).
  2. Clone this repo.
  3. Run `go test`.
  4. Make the failing tests pass, by replacing these types of `__variables__` with real values.

#### Cooler usage

If you want to have `go test` be run in your terminal any time you save a file and
are using a Mac, take a look at [fswatch](https://github.com/emcrisostomo/fswatch).

### Helpful References

Bookmark the [spec](http://golang.org/ref/spec) and the
[packages listing](http://golang.org/pkg/). You can also
run the Go website locally with `godoc -http=:8080`.

### Go support in Vim

Add this to your `~/.vimrc` file:

    set rtp+=/usr/local/go/misc/vim
    filetype plugin indent on
    syntax on
